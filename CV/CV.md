## A short bio

I got my high school degree in [Affiliated High School of Fujian Normal University](https://sdfz.fjnu.edu.cn/) in 2024.

Before 2023, I was an Olympiad Informatics Competitor, studying and researching with [chen_03](https://www.luogu.com/user/154520#article), [18Michael](https://www.cnblogs.com/18Michael). In the short but exciting 2-year competitive career, I have won gold medals in APIO(Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad), NOIWC(National Olympic Winter Camp in Informatics), and a silver medal in NOI(National Olympiad of Informatics). What's more significant, during the competitive career, I'm fortunate to have made lots of close friends, who have passion and talent in CS/math/...

In August 2024, I became a student in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), and I'm willing to become a researcher, a scientist, and a person who benefit society in the future.
